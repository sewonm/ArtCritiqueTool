**AI Art Critique Tool**

The purpose of this project is to develop an AI-driven art critique tool designed to assist artists in improving their artwork according to their specific goals. This tool aims to provide personalized feedback grounded in classical art principles and contemporary visual analysis techniques. By integrating AI and art critique, we seek to help artists enhance their skills and achieve their artistic vision.

Our mission is to bridge the gap between artistic aspirations and practical improvement through technology. This tool will serve as a mentor, guiding artists towards improvements in their chosen style or technique.
